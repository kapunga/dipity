## What Problem Are We Trying to Solve?

In the sudden move by many organizations to a remote-first office culture, one
complaint that comes up over and over again is the lack of workplace serendipity
and it's resulting negative impact on innovation. Those chance encounters at the
water cooler where two co-workers might share an idea they had been mulling over
and in the interaction, the idea blossoms into something more, a feature, an
experiment, a product. This is to say nothing of the workplace social
relationships that flourish in this environment.

While the richness of in-person social interation can never fully be replicated
online, _Dipity_ is an attempt to gain back some of what is lost in a move to
remote-first.

## Thesis: It's a Problem of Signaling

Signalling is tricky.
